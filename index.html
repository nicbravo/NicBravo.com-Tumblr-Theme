<h1 id="youcangetit:aqueerladiesfieldguidetofuckingnicbravo">You Can Get It: A Queer Ladies&#8217; Field Guide to Fucking Nic&nbsp;Bravo</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about why I don&#8217;t get fucked as much as I used to. Let me catch you up on a little personal history. [You can <a href="#thegoodstuff" target="_self">skip to the good stuff</a> if you want.]</p>

<p>When I first came out as a trans* lady it was a coming-out-to-myself. I was a bi cis guy at the time and dating a nice man, but the sex wasn&#8217;t working and I realized I had gender stuff I needed to confront. I broke off that relationship and immediately started having these really great sexual interactions with ladies I knew. These were mostly friends of mine, people with whom I had established a lot of trust, people who [saw me/knew me] as a man but with whom I could safely and comfortably discuss my gender explorations. This was around when I was coming out as trans* to everyone else. The sex was amazing. For two women in particular, I was the first lady they&#8217;d fucked, and they went right to town with it, reading onto my body all the things they&#8217;d always dreamed of doing to another girl. One of them named my pussy and my clit for the first time, and made me pass out from the attention. The other gave me my first experience as an enveloping subby bottom, and moved with me into an exploratory space of radical consent. </p>

<p>All of this great sex ended around the time I decided I wanted to get on hormones and start transforming my body. I was experiencing a lot of gendered body dysphoria: feeling that my body&#8217;s shape and appearance were at odds with the way I experienced my gender (and my sex). These feelings about my body made it really difficult to share sexual experiences with other people, and eventually made me stop altogether. I spent about 8 months in a self-imposed celibacy, both a physical and romantic one. I turned my energies inward, towards healing and growth. I masturbated as much as ever, and took as good care of myself as I knew how, but I didn&#8217;t have any sexual or emotional energy to share with anyone for a long time. </p>

<p>This emotional drought stopped when I gave up on waiting for a diagnosis letter from my therapist, fired them, and found a doc who would write me a scrip for hormones no-questions-asked. I started EEI (Exogenous Endocrine Intervention, a cocktail of hormones to transform my body) in winter of 2011. As my body changed, I quickly became more confident, happier, and more energetic. I started to feel like I could turn my energy outwards again, and I gave some thought to who I loved and who and how I wanted to fuck. Turns out, I love my friends (we already knew that, though, right?) and I want to fuck, or at least make out with, a lot of them. </p>

<p>But that&#8217;s when the weird started. I was visibly happier and more confident, my body was changing and becoming even more attractive (small, perky tits, smoother, softer skin, less muscle&#8230; all these changes I&#8217;d been desperate for for years) and yet I was getting less flirting and less attention from friends and strangers alike! I started to realize that the people I wanted to be physical with were primarily queer ladies who were used to eroticizing and interacting with cis female bodies. The weight of cisnormativity hit me like a ton of bricks. How was I ever going to get touched ever again?! This community of people I loved and desired was mired in the idea that my body was male, and therefore undesirable&#8230; it was a frightening thought. </p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I asked around. First, I asked around with my friends, who didn&#8217;t know what to say. Most of these people didn&#8217;t want to fuck me anyways, so that was kinda an obvious dead-end. After I had talked everyone&#8217;s ear off about this for a while (Dykes don&#8217;t want to fuck trans* ladies! Everyone thinks I have a dick! Wahhh!) someone suggested that I leave them alone and talk to someone who was or might be interested in a physical thing with me. So, I started asking around with those folks, and immediately things started making sense. </p>

<p>I got the same answers from everybody! &#8220;I totally want to fuck you, but…&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know how to touch you.&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d be afraid to say the wrong thing or fuck you the wrong way. &#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to talk about your body.&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you&#8217;re attracted to!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically: a lot of confusion, interest, fear, and concern. It&#8217;s out of that emotional moment in the people who want to fuck me that this document is born. I&#8217;m on a mission to show the members of my community that they <em>can and should</em> [eroticize/fuck/want to fuck] trans* bodies, especially/specifically institutionally-categorized-as-male trans* bodies, using my own non-binary trans* body as a case study.</p>

<p><a name="thegoodstuff"></a></p>

<h2 id="thegoodstuff"><strong>the good stuff</strong></h2>

<p>The thing is this: it&#8217;s <em>easy</em> to fuck me. I&#8217;m full of energy and desire, I&#8217;m tender, I&#8217;m a switch, I&#8217;m attentive, I&#8217;m kinky, and I&#8217;m a great educator. I want people to know that I&#8217;m a huge slut and that, if they want to fuck me, they should ask, cause probably they could get it.</p>

<h2 id="communication"><strong>communication</strong></h2>

<p>Almost everything you need to know to fuck me comes from the skills of explicit consensual communication, skills everyone should have and use in the bedroom and everywhere else! When I say “Ask me/tell me” just substitute “Ask yr lover” and voila, you&#8217;ve got a primer on consensual sex practices. </p>

<h3 id="callingthebodyintobeing">calling the body into being</h3>

<p>Ask me “how should I talk about yr body?” and I&#8217;ll tell you: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You probably already know that I&#8217;m a non-binary lady, neither male nor female, neither man nor woman. I like she/her/hers pronouns, by which I mean I don&#8217;t fuck anybody who calls me &#8216;he&#8217;, not for any price. Treat me like the femme lady I am, and please only use feminine language to talk about me and my body. </p>

<p>Between my legs I have a pussy. She might look different from some other pussies you&#8217;ve seen, but a pussy she is, and she&#8217;ll only open up to you if you call her by her proper name. She also answers to &#8216;cunt&#8217;! She has lips and a clit. You&#8217;ll learn all the details in person. </p>

<p>On my chest I have a rockin&#8217; pair of tits. There are so many names for them, and they answer to all of them. Love them. </p>

<p>In everyday life, I&#8217;m SUPER patient about misgendering. However, in bed it&#8217;s different. I have a zero tolerance policy for people I&#8217;m fucking regarding misgendering. If you call me man, dude, or he, or use the words dick, balls, cock, penis, testicles, etc. (I can&#8217;t even tell you how hard it is for me to write those words), I&#8217;ll kick you the fuck out. Misgendering is a huge turnoff. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="boundaries">boundaries</h3>

<p>Consent is very important to me. As a survivor of sexual violence, I like to constantly reclaim my body as my own by communicating my boundaries. Although I do get to a stage with long-term lovers where boundaries and consent have been established and we can get by without saying everything aloud, I like to communicate about boundaries A LOT with a new partner. For me, a continual renegotiation model works best. Ask me, </p>

<ul>
<li>“Do you want me to [touch you here, etc]?&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;Is it ok if I [whatever]?&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;Is this ok?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Do you want me to [blank]?&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;Where do you want to be touched?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>I have one boundary that I don&#8217;t usually break except in very special circumstances: tickling. I do not want to be tickled, intentionally or otherwise. If you tickle me accidentally we can move past it no problem; just don&#8217;t touch me for a moment, and give me space to calm down. If you tickle me intentionally, I&#8217;ll stop fucking you immediately, at least for the night and probably forever. I can&#8217;t express how serious I am about this. Don&#8217;t let my smiling or laughing fool you—listen to my words, I&#8217;ll be saying &#8220;Stop.&#8221; If you want to avoid tickling me, be careful about the soft parts at the sides and front of my belly and don&#8217;t rest yr weight on the fronts of my thighs. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll show you the right way to touch me if you let me.</p>

<h3 id="desires">desires</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s no point in communicating sexual/physical boundaries if we don&#8217;t also talk about what turns us on and how we like to fuck! It&#8217;s very important to me that my sex not be based on expectation. I have a potentially unlimited diversity of things I like to do to my lovers and have done to me, ways I like to fuck. Similarly, I don&#8217;t go into any new physical relationship with specific expectations of what acts will be performed. I like to talk about my desires and practices in neutral ways that don&#8217;t sound like requests, at least at first. I might say &#8220;I really like it when my lovers do [x] to me&#8230; is that something you like to do?&#8221; I don&#8217;t mind at all if you express yr desires more forcefully (&#8220;Scratch bloody lines into my back while you eat me out, you fucking slut!!&#8221;), but you&#8217;ve got to be prepared for me to say no, because I will whenever I feel like it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m into a few things specifically. I love to go down on people—it&#8217;s my favorite thing, and while it&#8217;s not a deal breaker, we&#8217;ll match best if you like to get eaten out. I like to top and bottom, and I can be dominant or submissive. I&#8217;m happy to switch as well, in response to yr style or mood. I like consensual non-consent play, including being restrained and choked, teased and humiliated, and play-raped. I enjoy pain play of all kinds: scratching, tearing, impact play, pinching, pulling, and painful tying among others. I like long, slow, tender touch sessions when I&#8217;m in the right mood. I love to get fingered, and I&#8217;m siked to show you each of the five parts of me I want you inside of. I also love to have my tits played with in all sorts of ways, especially in ways that affirm their existence. I&#8217;m super interested in being fucked with a strap-on or a strapless; if you&#8217;ve got one you want to use on me, bring it along! </p>

<p>I&#8217;m very open and very kinky, so whether yr kinks are well practiced or just fantasy, bring them along too!</p>

<p>Most of what we&#8217;ll do we can teach each other or make up as we go. The only thing we have to prepare for is safe sex practices. For my body, gloves and barriers are a good way to prevent fluid exchange. Please talk to me if you don&#8217;t want to use latex, so I can prepare with non-latex barriers. We can use manufactured barriers (&#8216;dental dams&#8217;), a split condom, or plastic wrap if we&#8217;re feeling really wild and messy. Speaking of messy, I like to have plenty of lube around. If we&#8217;re gonna risk exchanging any fluids beyond kissing, I want us both to be tested so we know our risk. Using barriers does not eliminate the risk of exchanging fluids. For tons of great ideas about safe sex practices for trans* folks, check out Trans Sexualities in the resources list at the end of this work.</p>

<h2 id="whysexandwhenareyoufree"><strong>Why sex? And when are you free?</strong></h2>

<p>I believe in sex as a project, sex as work, sex as play, sex within friendships, sex within romantic relationships, and sex as community building. <a href="http://thedistantpanic.com">Sadie Vasthi</a> said this beautiful thing in an article she wrote called &#8220;<a href="http://thedistantpanic.com/2011/01/18/the-best-of-both-worlds-can-tranny-whores-also-be-tranny-chasers-or-toward-a-trans-centric-sexuality/">Best of Both Worlds</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When (relatively) free from patriarchal, heterosexist, transphobic norms, sex can be a great way to create friendships, networks of trust, and tangible affinity — if that’s what all parties involved want out of it, of course.  </p>

<p>As a community organizer, that’s basically everything I could ever hope to do. Building community is what I’m all about.  </p>

<p>Sex can help us learn about each other intimately. Sometimes it can be just as frustrating as an endless debate over consensus process. But it’s a good way to get close (literally and figuratively) with people who have been through a lot of the same shit that we have. It helps us to heal one another, and to work toward creating something better together.</p>

<p>I believe in touch and physicality, in their ability to make us feel [right/whole/a sense of belonging] with(in) [ourselves/each other/our communities]. I also believe in courtship. If you know me and think I&#8217;m cute (I am), you should call me up or tweet me or whatever. Take me out for tea. Then let&#8217;s go somewhere and fuck each other silly. </p>
